# Spreadsheet Icons

The Spreadsheet component in Odoo uses a dedicated set of icons optimized for grid interactions and formula editing.

These are often SVG-based or font-based within the `o-spreadsheet` namespace.

**Usage:**
Typically internal to the spreadsheet client action and not frequently used directly in standard backend views unless extending the spreadsheet component itself.

For general backend UI, usage of standard [Odoo Icons](odoo_ui_icons.md) is preferred.
